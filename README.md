# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview:
This Rock Paper Scissors project is a web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play the classic Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer. Players can choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

## Features:
- **Player Input:** Users can select their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
- **Computer Selection:** The computer randomly selects its move after the player makes a selection.
- **Result Display:** The game displays the player's and computer's moves, as well as the outcome of the round (win, lose, or draw).
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the player's score, updating it based on the outcome of each round.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** Used for structuring the game interface and buttons.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the visual presentation of the game elements, including buttons and score display.
- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing the game logic, including player input handling, computer move generation, and determining the winner of each round.

## Usage:
1. **Choosing Moves:**
   - Click on the "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" buttons to select your move.
2. **Viewing Results:**
   - The game displays your move, the computer's move, and the outcome of the round (win, lose, or draw).

## Learnings:
Through the Rock Paper Scissors project, I gained insights into various aspects of web development:
- **HTML Structure:** Designing the game interface using HTML taught me about structuring elements and creating interactive components.
- **CSS Styling:** Applying CSS styles to the game elements allowed me to enhance the visual presentation and user experience.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Implementing the game logic in JavaScript helped me understand event handling, conditionals, and random number generation.
- **Interactive UI:** Creating an interactive game interface improved my understanding of <b><i> DOM manipulation and  updating content dynamically.</b></i>
